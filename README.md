Processed and cleaned student performance data by handling missing values and preparing structured datasets. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze trends in study habits, attendance, sleep patterns, and mental health. Visualized relationships through histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to gain meaningful insights. Built and compared multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and optimized model performance using GridSearchCV with evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R² score. Selected the best-performing model, saved it using Joblib for reuse, and developed an interactive Streamlit-based prediction interface to estimate exam scores based on user inputs.
